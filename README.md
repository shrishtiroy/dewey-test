# Dewey 

A book social media web app built with React + Vite + Tailwind CSS. It uses the Open Library API for books and allows users to rate and rank favorites with pairwise comparisons (like how Belli ranks restaurants), create fun reading lists lists (shelves), and track yearly reading progress.

This repo demonstrates the view of a single user. Social features (followers/live feeds) are not implemented.

## Features

- Search Open Library for books and display covers/metadata
- Trending books view (uses Open Library search)
- Rate and rank books using pairwise comparisons
- Create and manage book lists (shelves)
- Track yearly reading progress with a simple goal tracker
- Tailwind CSS and reusable components
